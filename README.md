## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is my first project for Udacity data science nano degree course. I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. Is there an area in Seattle where there are more choices of rentals with relatively lower price?
2. Can I predict the price of Seattle Airbnb rentals?
3. Which Seattle area has most rentals with good reviews in recent two years?
4. Which Airbnb rentals are recommended in downtown Seattle?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

I don't include any Seattle Airbnb data here since the data can be downloaded automatically in the notebook. Note that I am using the data compiled by 23 April, 2020. If the data is updated on the Airbnb [website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), you will get some different results by running this notebook.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@weixind/how-do-i-find-my-favorite-airbnb-rental-in-seattle-218ff759e735).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Airbnb link available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
